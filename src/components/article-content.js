        `Welcome back React is the first programming language that can easily be learn by anyone in a very short duration. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages`,
        `and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum`,

        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. `,

        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
        very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.`
